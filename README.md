a Chrome Extension that lets you save, organize, and revisit your favorite verses instantly while browsing.

Have you ever used  https://dailyverses.net/random-bible-verse website and had to take screenshots of your favorite versesâ€¦ like me? ðŸ˜…

I got tired of losing track of the verses that inspired me, so I built FAITH NOTES Bible Verse Saver â€“ a Chrome Extension that lets you save, organize, and revisit your favorite verses instantly while browsing.

âœ¨ What it does:

Automatically shows the verse on the page

Save it with one click into a clean, card-style list

Fully offline, fast, and lightweight â€“ no external scripts

This project helped me develop my first Chrome Extension development ,while solving a real problem I faced every day.

If you love capturing inspiration and never losing a verse again, this is for you! ðŸ™Œ All you got to do is enable the extension and use it
